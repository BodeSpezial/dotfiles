# Dotfiles
I store most of my dotfiles for all the applications I use frequently enough to take them easily with me to a new machine.

## List of current configurations

### nvim 

I switched to using nvim instead of vim but am currently still using the .vim configuration file.
A few options might be missing or not work, when using the configuration with vim though because of the presets of nvim (and some plugins might only work with nvim).

#### Plugins used
* COC for completion
    * LaTeX
    * CSS
    * 
* vimtex
* NERDTree with
    * syntax highlighting and
    * devicons
* Surround
* fzf
* rainbow
* Go
* Airline with themes (term)
* Emmet
#### Some settings I find worth mentioning
* I mapped `jj` to escape because of the shitty placement on standard keyboards.

### git
Some standard settings. I didn't change much.
Most interesting is probably the `git l` alias. I found an article (if I should find it in the future I'll gladly give credit where it is due, but I can't remember) about the styling of the log output and pretty much copy/pasted it with some minor tweaks

### starship 
* Disabled aws because although I have it configuered I barely use it.
* Removed branch symbol
* Add a nice charging thunder
* Added a little gopher for the go version

### fish
* Initialize starship and thefuck.
* Use bat as the manpager to have some nice coloring.
* Set some env vars for node and haskell.

#### Functions
* Because I use LaTeX quite a bit I wrote myself a little function to compile and then clean the current folder.
* The rest are just aliases.

### a custom tex class
As mentioned above I use LaTeX and so I created a class for my scripts.

### X

### iterm 

### bash
More or less. 
I probably have some configuration saved here but since I'm mostly using fish I don't use or keep them updated. Maybe I'll delete 'em some time.

### feh

### i3

### wtf

### polybar

### picom
